TODO
----
- include packet size and version no. in join request so incompatiable falcon peers cannot join eachother
- peer who is not keepalive master does not get latency updates - should KeepAlive master tell them latency they have for peer?
- consider determining addresses to broadcast to at time of discovery not at startup (could have changed, though it does take time to calc this)
- in addition to above problem more generally local addresses cache should be refreshed when network changes have occured
- quick disconnect when network disconnected

Universal
---------
- best way to get local addresses?
- UPnP


One day
-------
- IPv6 and other underlying protocols support
- Optimistic Reliable congestion controlled delivery
