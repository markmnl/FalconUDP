   ---------------------------
   
       [0]     Packet detail byte (see below).

       [2]     } Sequence number as unsigned 16 bit integer

       [4]     } Payload Size as unsigned 16 bit integer
       
       [n]     }
       ...     } Payload (if any, i.e. size > 0)
       [m]     } 
       
  [ optional additional packet - if any bytes remain in datagram
 
       [m+1]   Packet detail byte (see below).
       
       [m+2]   }
       [m+3]   } Payload Size as unsigned 16 bit integer
       
       [m+4]   } 
       ...     } Payload (if any, i.e. size > 0)
       [o]     }
  
     ... possible multiple additional packets

   ACKs
   ----
   ACKs are special, they are the same size as a FalonUDP header and have seq, Send Options and 
   Packet Type stored at the same place, however the values have different meanings. A FalconUDP
   packet can start with an ACK or have them after any application packet within (this is so they 
   can "piggy-back" on existing outgoing datagrams without triggering a new one).

   What each FalconUDP header value means in an ACK:
   
   PacketType   = Will always be ACK
   Sequence No. = Sequence ACK is for
   SendOptions  = Channel ACK is for (however can be sent on any channel)
   Payload size = Undefined
       

   NOTE:
   -----
   
   All numbers in FalconUDP headers are unsigned integers stored in Little-Endian byte order.

   Additional packets are only appended in a Falcon packet if they fit wholley within 
   without packet exceeding MAX_PACKET_SIZE.

   Additional packets have to have the same SendOptions as byte [1] in the Falcon header.
